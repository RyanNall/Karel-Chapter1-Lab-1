/**
 * Write a description of class Count here.
1.      Use // style comments to add a comment header at the top of the file that includes the name of the program, your name, and a brief description of what the program does, neatly formatted. Include a delimiter line (e.g., all stars) at the beginning and end of the header. 
	Answer: Count.java, Ryan Nall, Counts from 1 to 5 in English, French, and Spanish
2.      Add a comment before each println that indicates what language the next line is in. Experiment with leaving a blank line before each of these comment lines (in the program itself, not the output). Is the program easier to read with or without these blank lines?
	Answer: Yes
3.      Remove one of the slashes from one of your comment lines and recompile the program, so one of the comments starts with a single /. What error do you get? Put the slash back in.
	Answer: Semi colon expected
4.      Try putting a comment within a comment, so that a // appears after the initial // on a comment line. Does this cause problems?
	Answer: No
